This is a passion project of mine, I like birds and wanted to build something about them!

## Getting Started
I used this cloudflare template to start: 
```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/astro-blog-starter-template
```
## Project Structure

Will add more later.

Essentially I pull from my r2 bucket where my parquet file that is built with my backend
